        Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming
        model. React Router is a collection of navigational components that
        compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have
        bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in
        React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering--so take
        your pick!
